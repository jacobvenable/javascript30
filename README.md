# javascript30
My local repository for storing my [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge files. Javascript30 is a free progam that helps with honing your vanilla JS skillz and was created by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). Big thanks to him!

This repo contains 30 folders that correspond to one day of the challenge. Within each folder is either index-myAttempt.html or index-START.html and index-FINISHED.html:
- suffixed with "myAttempt": my attempt at the challenge before watching the video
- suffixed with "START": created while following along with the video.
- suffixed with "FINISHED": the example finished challenge created by Wes.
