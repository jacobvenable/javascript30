    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; //this is just a reference to the array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //this will update players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name:'Jane Doe',
        age:39
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    // console.log(person,person2);
    // person2.age = 50;
    // console.log(person,person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age:99});
    console.log(person,person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const person4 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const dog = {
        name:'Spot',
        age:4,
        food:{
            dry:'purina',
            treat:'greenies'
        }
    };

    const dog2 = Object.assign({},dog); //this is also 1 level deep. If you change 'dry' in the 'food' object of dog2, this affects the corresponding value in dog.

    //not recommended but works for a deep clone
    const dog3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dog));
    //check performance?
